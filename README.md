A quick start nodeJS Server with express and mongoDB

# How to start the boilerplate
In order to start the server you will need an instance of a mongoDB as well as node installed.
You can run the mongoDB in a docker container if you choose to do so.
Aside from this you will need to set some env variables.

### Env Variables to set
* LOG_LEVEL - The log level you want to see (defaults to debug)
* PORT - The port the server will be running on (defaults to 3001)
* MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING - The string to connecto to mongoDB. This has no default.
